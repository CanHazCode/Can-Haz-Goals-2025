# A webpage to practice CSS
This webpage is themed around my goals and achievements towards them for 2025. I will be building it throughout the year, learning new elements as I go. The individual elements will also be available separately and there will be a blog write up on each piece. This is the sum of all the parts in a cohesive design. 

The theme for 2025 for me is turning things around. As such the webpage will feature several flip and turn animations.
